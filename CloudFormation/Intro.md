## CloudFormation vs AWS CLI: What‚Äôs the Difference?

CloudFormation (CFT) is used to create the infrastructure in the cloud (IAC).

- We know that **AWS CLI** can also be used to manage and create infrastructure, so how is it different from CloudFormation?

- Usually, you write code to develop something using Java, Python, C, and many more languages ‚Äî but CFT is basically used to create infrastructure in the cloud.


## When to Use AWS CLI and When to Use CloudFormation

- **CLI** is used when you have to perform a task very quickly and take short actions.
- **CFT** is used to create a whole stack of infrastructure in a structured, repeatable, and automated way.


| Use Case                     | Use AWS CLI                       | Use CloudFormation (CFT)                |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Quick actions               | ‚úÖ Yes                             | ‚ùå Overkill                              |
| Full environment setup      | ‚ùå Tedious manually                | ‚úÖ Ideal with reusable templates         |
| Automation & repeatability  | ‚ùå Difficult to track              | ‚úÖ Version-controlled & reproducible     |
| One-time config             | ‚úÖ Great                           | ‚ùå Unnecessary complexity                |
| Team collaboration          | ‚ùå Hard to share commands          | ‚úÖ Easy to share YAML/JSON templates     |

## YAML vs JSON

- **YAML** allows commenting, which is useful for documentation and clarity more readable.
- **JSON** does **not** support comments.

## Features of CloudFormation

### ‚úÖ Drift Detection

Drift detection is used to identify if any manual changes have been made to the resources that were provisioned by a CloudFormation stack.

**Example 1:**
- You deployed an **S3 bucket with versioning enabled** using CFT.
- Someone disabled versioning manually.
- Drift detection will show a mismatch.

**Example 2:**
- Your CFT enabled **detailed monitoring** for an EC2 instance.
- Someone disabled it manually.
- Drift detection will alert you.


### ‚úçÔ∏è Final Thoughts

- Use **CLI** for short, quick tasks or scripting.
- Use **CFT** when you need structure, automation, and team collaboration.
- YAML is easier to read and maintain compared to JSON.
- CFT gives you visibility and consistency over your infrastructure.
